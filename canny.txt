Pipelined and parallel DUT module of the Canny Edge Decoder

Issues faced during compilation:

1. Simulation time was obtained successfully in step 5 but the image generated does not match the reference image.
2. Conversion error while calculating value of fps


Solution to these issues:

1. There were missing pixels when I viewed the image. I found that the range should have been (ROWS/4)*1 - 1 but I put (ROWS/4)*1. Once I fixed it, the images matched.
2. I calculated fps by using 1/(t-t_previous) instead of 1/(t-t_previous).to_seconds(). Once I fixed that, it worked.
